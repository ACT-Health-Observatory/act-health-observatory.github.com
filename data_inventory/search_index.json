First we describe the approach to use a relational data model of linking files within datasets within projects. Files, Datasets and Projects in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema is defined by the ‘Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity’ - KNB (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools/eml). A schematic diagram of the EML modules: The figure below shows EML as a hierarchy. An EML document contains a dataset module that allows the grouping of one or more data entities (e.g. a file) linked together by particular rules to form a Data Package. The project module places the dataset that is being documented into its larger research context, and allows multiple related Data Packages to be linked. Motivation/Justification The backend uses a web2py database app, and R helper functions written by Ivan Hanigan There is a need for a data inventory tool to enable ecological data collections to be managed more efficiently The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) provides an excellent standardised schema for metadata, but the associated software Morpho does not have the flexibility or extensibility that would enable a data manager to use it to manage large and heterogeneous data collections KNB is a subproject of Ecoinformatics.org (http://ecoinformatics.org/) an open source collaboration that aims to produce software, systems, and services primarily for the ecological sciences. We apply these to Human Ecology systems too. XML A minimal EML document is summarised below. This is a schematic view that shows the structure of an EML XML document. Only a few of the possible components are included. In the graphic above the mandatory component of the EML is shown as a firm line, in contrast with those aspects of the EML which are not mandatory (dotted lines). That is: dataset title, creator and contact are the only required elements for a valid EML Data Package. &lt;eml&gt; &lt;dataset&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;creator&gt; &lt;contact&gt; &lt;project&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;personnel&gt; &lt;role&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;funding&gt; &lt;studyAreaDescription&gt; &lt;designDescription&gt; &lt;relatedProject&gt; &lt;associatedParty&gt; &lt;publisher&gt; &lt;pubDate&gt; &lt;keywords&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;intellectualright&gt; &lt;methods&gt; &lt;coverage&gt; &lt;dataTable&gt; &lt;entityName&gt; &lt;entityDescription&gt; &lt;physical&gt; &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; &lt;additionalLinks&gt; The parts of an EML document In EML, the term dataset is applied to a document which may contain general information such as the title, creator, and contacts, abstract and keywords as well as one or more data entities, such as datatables, that provide more specific research details. The information is at the level of a particular data collection or study, however there is also a level above this at the “project” level where research studies can be grouped together. In EML, the term dataset refers to one or more data entities. However, there is no generally accepted practice on what to include in an EML-dataset document. Some people will choose to have a one-to-one correspondence between an EML document and a data entity and a single physical file. Others will document several data entities in one dataset document. Below is a brief description of the way we interpret the components of an EML dataset Datasets Dataset is the top level of the EML. The miminum necessary to produce a valid EML document is &lt;title&gt;, &lt;creator&gt;, &lt;contract&gt;. But one can’t tell very much with just a title and a name. Our aim is to create an EML document that contains enough information about the data and research to make funding agencies happy and give other ecologists something to work with. Datasets may include one or more data entities such as data tables and spatial images along with associated metadata, but inclusion of data entities are not mandatory. The dataset module enables entities which are linked together to be grouped logically. LTERN groups entities into a single dataset using a range of integrity constraints such as the use of a specific sampling structure or monitoring theme employed over a discrete temporal and geographic range. In the context of the work undertaken by the LTERN Data Portal Team, the term dataset is sometimes used interchangeably with the term data package, however it should be recognised that these are not exactly the same. The dataset module is a part of an EML document which forms the basis for a data package. In EML, the dataset tag contains general information about a dataset; at minimum this must comprise a title, one Data Creator and a contact (often the Data Creator and contact will be the same). Additional information such as abstract, temporal coverage, keywords, geographic coverage and methods are used to provide context for the published or archived data packages. For more information about the general EML descriptions see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-resource.html For more detailed information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataset.html Projects The project module is optional, but in many cases highly desirable as this provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context with which that dataset is associated. For example it might be an entire Longterm Ecological Research Network (LTER) site, or an individual project at an LTER site. The EML “project” module of the EML enables data packages to be grouped logically together. The project module is primarily used by LTERN to identify the Data Owner and the source of funding. The project module is recursive in that it provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context for the specific project with which that data package is associated. Information in the project tag of the EML include detailed descriptions of the aims and objectives of the research, funding sources, personnel and a description of the study area. This module also includes content on the study and sampling design and the methods employed during the research. As an example, a project might comprise an entire Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTERN) plot network or an individual project at an LTERN site. For more information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-project.html Data Entity As stated earlier, a dataset consists of one or more data entities, and the most common data entity is a dataTable. A data table is something that looks like a matrix with rows for observations and columns for variables In addition to datatables, people using database applications may also produce a view from a database management system or a storedProcedure that results in data output. People using GIS (geographical information system) applications generate both spatialVector, also referred to as boundary or shape files, and spatialRaster. A spatialRaster is a geo-referenced image usually produced by a camera on a satellite or other remote sensing device. The final kind of data entity is otherEntity. An otherEntity is a data entity that cannot be represented by any of the previously defined data entity structures. A non-geo-referenced photograph is an otherEntity, e.g., a photograph of two different types of butterflies. For more information about types of EML-entities see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/#N10115 Attributes An attribute or as it is sometime referred to, variable, in this context refers to the name of the column of a datatable For more information about the EML dataTable type (especially its attributes) see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataTable.html#attribute "],

Assessment of the impacts of air pollution on population health and evaluation of trends relative to other major risk factors requires regularly updated, accurate, spatially resolved exposure estimates. We combined satellite-based estimates, chemical transport model simulations, and ground measurements from 79 different countries to produce global estimates of annual average fine particle (PM2.5) and ozone concentrations at 0.1Â° Ã— 0.1Â° spatial resolution for five-year intervals from 1990 to 2010 and the year 2013. These estimates were applied to assess population-weighted mean concentrations for 1990-2013 for each of 188 countries. (See Environ. Sci.

The geometry for road and rail lines was based on the centreline of these roads / rail with arbitrary values based on road or rail classification. Eg 75 dB for freeways and stepping down in 5 dB increments for each drop in road classification. For buildings, the cadastral boundaries that were residential and created a polygon within a few meters or so away from the cadastral line. Then the 2011 Mesh Block and Census data were used. A population estimate was attached to each building based on the volume of the building (ie building footprint area * the height), as to assign a greater number of people to larger, taller buildings (eg unit blocks) compare to single dwellings. Then a noise level was calculated for each building for the road lines. These noise levels are based on the noise levels around each building facade and provide not only the maximum noise level at each building, but also an average and minimum noise levels around each building, acknowledging not everyone lives in the loudest room of each house.

International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 83(7), 833â€“842. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-010-0534-2 | | The study focused on five regions in NSW: Sydney East; Sydney West; Gosford- Wyong; Newcastle and Illawarra. Cooler nights in Sydney West and cooler days in Sydney East provided the rationale for dividing Sydney into East and West. Data from Sydney weather stations were used to define two temperature regions (Sydney West and Sydney East) by maximising the ratio of between groups to within- group temperature variance. Statistical local areas (SLA) within Sydney were then assigned to the west and east regions. SLA of residence was used to assign patients to Sydney East, Sydney West, Illawarra, Gosford-Wyong and Newcastle. The average of weather and air pollution observations from all monitoring stations in each region was used. | | Subsequently Ivan Hanigan based the creation of a new spatial dataset for the Biomass Smoke and Human Health collaboration that included many other cities and towns.

The Index reaches a peak in January when average values of 11 or more cover virtually all of Australia. These values are clear-sky values only, conditions would otherwise be somewhat tempered by the cloudiness associated with the monsoon in the north. The lowest values occur in June-July where the UV Index averages less than 2 over Tasmania, increasing to almost 8-9 in far northern Australia.

It includes natural and man-made geographic features such as: watercourse areas, swamps, reservoirs, canals, etc. This product presents hydrology polygon features which will topological connect with the hydrology line features and forms a complete flow path network for the entire continent of Australia.http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/83134 (regional) This dataset provides sets of related features classes to be used as the basis of the production of consistent hydrological information. This dataset contains a geometric representation of major hydrographic polygon elements - both natural and artificial. This dataset is the best available data supplied by Jurisdictions and aggregated by Geoscience Australia.

Rather than 75M radial buffers this is calculated for CCD boundaries as the exposure buffers. Uses CCD 2006 edition. WRD is calculated using an ArcGIS tool. In the GeoSEEF folder the ‘Weighted Road Density CCD 2006.mxd’ file refered to the WRD_CCD_2006 layer in the GeoSEEF.gdb. This was extracted as a standalone shapefile for work with R. It is stored in data_provided_extracts_for_urch/WRD_CCD_2006.shp. This is the same as the CCD in the 130409/Shapefiles folder. The lpk layer file in the 130409 folder is comparable.
