This simulation considers where, when, why and how everyone travelled. It contains detailed information on the interaction between all zones modelled. Most recent traffic counts from state and local governments are then used to produce Zenith traffic estimates. Estimates may contain aberrations, for instance, due to seasonal variations, weather conditions or public/school holidays. </td> </tr>

Estimates may contain aberrations, for instance, due to seasonal variations, weather conditions or public/school holidays. A matrix estimation process is used to fine tune the simulated traffic volumes to that of the traffic counts. </td> </tr>
