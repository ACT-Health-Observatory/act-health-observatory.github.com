  <tr> <td align="right"> abstract </td> <td> Digital Cadastral and Topographic data consist of spatial layers, representing different aspects of land and property boundaries in NSW. Key types of data in the Cadastral database include: Governmental boundaries such as Local Government Areas, State and Federal Electoral Districts, and other Administrative Areas Property boundaries including lots within deposited plans and strata plans Suburbs Proclaimed boundaries for State Forests, National Park & Wildlife Reserves and Local Land Services Road corridors and centrelines Boundaries of bodies of water The data was developed originally from paper maps and plans and is constantly updated based on registration of land transactions in NSW, as well as changes in administrative boundaries. The topographic database includes natural physical and man-made features. Key elements include: Physical contours and elevations Cultural features such as buildings, schools and hospitals Hydrology features including the coastline and drainage patterns Transport features such as road, rail and ferry routes Utility features such as electricity transmission lines and pipelines The data is continuously maintained through a program of data exchanges with many organisations throughout NSW, as well as utilising Spatial Services regularly updated aerial imagery. The data is also used for producing topographical maps for the state. </td> </tr>
