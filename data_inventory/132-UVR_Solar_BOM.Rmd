  <tr> <td align="right"> abstract </td> <td> Average noon clear-sky, solar ultraviolet radiation Index across Australia in raster format. Data includes averages per year and per season (summer, autumn, winter and spring). |  | These data are downloaded from http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/uv-index/index.jsp?period=a where they are used by BOM to create heat maps of solar radiation. These maps show the average annual, monthly and seasonal values of the UV Index over Australia for the period 1979-2007 under cloud-free conditions at local noon, when the sun is at its highest. These values are also representative of the values expected between 11 am and 1 pm local time (12 pm and 2 pm daylight saving time) under clear skies. |  | The UV Index provides a simple measure of the solar UV radiation level at the earths surface and thereby the potential for skin damage. Values can vary from zero upwards - the higher the value the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Protective measures need to be taken for UV Index values of 3 or above. |  | The patterns of average monthly clear-sky UV Index largely follow latitude lines with the highest values generally in the north of the continent and the lowest in the south. The Index reaches a peak in January when average values of 11 or more cover virtually all of Australia. These values are clear-sky values only, conditions would otherwise be somewhat tempered by the cloudiness associated with the monsoon in the north. The lowest values occur in June-July where the UV Index averages less than 2 over Tasmania, increasing to almost 8-9 in far northern Australia. It is the varying intensity of solar radiation and ozone throughout the year that mostly accounts for this variation of the UV Index which is evident on the monthly and seasonal maps. |  | Further information | The Ultra Violet (UV) Index - http://www.bom.gov.au/uv/index.shtml | World Health Organisation Intersun Global UV project - https://www.who.int/uv/en/ | How to protect your skin from sun damage - SunSmart. -  | Information about the range of gridded climate data we can provide. | Additional climate products and services </td> </tr>
