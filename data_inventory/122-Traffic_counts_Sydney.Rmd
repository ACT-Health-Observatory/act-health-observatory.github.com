  <tr> <td align="right"> abstract </td> <td> Traffic counts for Bankstown area. Notes from Ed:  |  | Traffic control departments of LGAs monitor traffic on local roads.  | Councils only count for high-ish load roads â€“ not complete. |  | Each LGA conducts their traffic data collections independently. Each  | of the LGAs in the region was approached and out of the 15 LGAs, only 5  | responded positively by sending through their data.  |  | Some LGAs stated that they werenâ€™t able to extract the data the way  | we required (en masse). All of the LGAs which responded currently use  | Metro Count to collect and extract traffic count data. This is a company |  which provides the hardware and software to compile the data into  | reports. Metro Count gave us a copy of their software so that we could  | extract the data ourselves if the LGA was willing to give us the raw  | files. LGA traffic counts did not seem to be conducted consistently  | between areas; time periods, types of road, presentation of data  | differed.  |  | Only some provided geocoding. As with RMS data, counts were available |  only for limited roads and assumptions would need to be made for all  | other roads. If we had received all the traffic data from LGAs, the  | process of compiling the data may have taken some weeks and due to the  | inconsistency between councils, may not have been highly reliable. </td> </tr>
