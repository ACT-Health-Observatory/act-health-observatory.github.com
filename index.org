** Overview
The Observatory is concerned with the current spatial variability and
trends of neighbourhood-level population health outcomes and risk
factors in the Australian Capital Region. The region is composed of
Canberra and the 17 surrounding Local Government Areas. Additional
links with the National UC Regional Wellbeing Survey and the Sydney PH
Observatory also provide the observatory a multi-scaled perspective
that sees population health in an ecological framework ranging from
micro, meso and macro scale factors. Stakeholders include ACT Health
and the Heart Foundation.

** Key aims of the observatory

The observatory aims to support those working to improve public health and reduce health inequalities by:

1. producing and disseminating health intelligence
1. strengthening research evidence for policy and practice.

*** Understanding patterns in the data
We act as a source of expertise in health intelligence, indicator development and inequalities measurement, and act as catalyst for population health improvement. A particular focus is on research that solves cross-scale data problems in health data collections and analysis. 
*** Explanatory statistical modelling
We apply state-of-the-art statistical techniques to mortality and disease modelling and cost estimates. This enhances our understanding of health determinants in the region.
*** Capacity building
We actively try to build research resources with our stakeholders and engaging relevant other policy communities. We advise on methods of evaluation and health impact. We aim to facilitate the translation of health intelligence into evidence-informed policy and practice and increase co-research capacity, between academics, policy makers, practitioners and Non-Government Organisations (NGO).
*** Sharing data 
We aspire to develop an online, searchable collection of aggregated data sets together with interactive presentation tools and spatial mapping capability.
